# Overview

I created this program to help me learn Kotlin, I don't know many programming languages and this is my first adventure to try and learn a new one. I am creating a program that allows you to add, remove, edit and search recipes.

I created this so that I can turn it into an App, so i can stop having to fumble with my recipe book and have my recipes all over the place. I have like 3 recipes books and i want to reduce that down to this program.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used Jetbrains Intellij IDE to work in Kotlin, the work environment is simple and easy to understand and allowed me to learn quickly, i used the documentation as well as video tutorials and anything else i could find to create this kotlin Program.
Kotlin is usually used for Android App development and is why i choose to learn it as i am seeking to create an app.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Check for User typing strings instead of ints and allowing them to do actions by typing them instead of using the numbers
- Create a User Interface
- Store the data in a database that can save this data locally
- Clean up the interface and make it clearer
- allow the user to search by category, ingredient, and steps individually rather than searching everything.
